# Ada Developers Academy Rails Homework

## Viewing the Website
In order to view the website, download the project, run bundle install, and start up the rails server. Then you can view the website at localhost:3000

## CRUD Implementation
There were aspects of the CRUD implementation that I decided to make "hidden" to normal users. Additional functionality can be accessed through the "admin" page at http://localhost:3000/admin.

## About the Project
This website was created for a homework project for Ada Developers Academy. Some of the requirements for the project were:
- At least two models that have some sort of relationship to one another
- At least two controllers that handle actions for the two models

I decided to create a website that provided past, current and prospective students of Ada Developers Academy information about companies that have sponsored Ada internships.
